# TodoMVC Onboarding
Showcase different ways to add a complex onboarding to an existing TodoMVC app

Adding an onboarding (not a simple carousel) to an existing application is a transversal concern that can be quite hard. It may require to modify or refactor the initial app. It seems to me a good way to mesure how hard it can be to add a new requirement to an existing application, and maintain it over the long run. It can also permit to evaluate which ways are creating more or less coupling between app components.

The point of this repository is to take existing TodoMVC implementations in different frontend technologies, and show different ways of implementing an onboarding on top of it.

I've mostly created this repository to show how [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) can be helpful so my first target is to provide an implementation in both redux-saga and redux-thunk, but I hope other technologies like Elm and CycleJs will give a try too.
