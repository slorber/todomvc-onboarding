Showcase different ways to add a complex onboarding to a TodoMVC app

Adding an onboarding (not a simple carousel) to an existing application is a transversal concern that can be quite hard to do. 

The point of this repository is to take existing TodoMVC implementations in different frontend technologies, and show different ways of implementing an onboarding on top of it.

I've mostly created this repository to show how redux-saga can be helpful so my first target is to provide an implementation in both redux-saga and redux-thunk, but I hope other technologies like Elm and CycleJs will give a try too.
